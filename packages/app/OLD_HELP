ntv - show available nix packages versions

USAGE:
   ntv [options] PKG_ATTRIBUTE_NAME...

PKG_ATTRIBUTE_NAME:
   A package attribute name like `emacs` or `python312Packages.pip`.
   Use https://search.nixos.org to find the attribute name for a package.

   If you don't know the attribute name, you can search for packages
   by query (prefixed by `~`) or by program name (prefixed by `bin/`).

   For example `~ cursor editor` will search the index at search.nixos.org for
   packages that match the query.

   And using `bin/pip` will search for packages that provide that program.

   Optionally you can add a version constraint to the package name like
   `bin/emacs@^25.x` or `emacs@>= 25 <= 27` or `~ git porcelain @latest`.

OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help and exit
   --version   show version and exit

   FILTERING

   --constraint         Only include results that match a versions constraint. eg: '~1.0'.
                        See https://github.com/Masterminds/semver?tab=readme-ov-file#basic-comparisons

                        Constraint can also be part of PKG_ATTRIBUTE_NAME if it contains an `@` symbol.
                          'emacs@^25.x'        - Show all Emacs in the `25.x` series.
                          'emacs@>= 25 <= 27'  - Show all Emacs in the `25.x`-`27.x` series.
                          'emacs@latest'       - Only show the most recent emacs.
                          'emacs@latest<25'    - Only show the latest emacs before the `25` series
                          'emacs@latest~29'    - Only show the most recent emacs of the `29` series

                        If the value after `@` is a readable file, it will be read as a version constraint.
                        This is useful for reading the version from a file like `.node-version`, etc.
                          'bin/node@.node-version'

   --exact              Only include results whose attribute is exactly PKG_ATTRIBUTE_NAME (default: false)
                        When searching for executable programs like `bin/foo`, `--exact=false` returns
                        packages having any program that contains `foo` as part of its name.

   --limit n            Limit to a number of results. 1 means only last and `-1` only first. (default: 0)
   --reverse            New versions first (default: false)
   --sort               Sorted by version instead of using backend ordering (default: true)

   FORMAT

   --text               Output text table of versions (default: true)
   --json               Output JSON array of versions (default: false)
   --installable        Output as list of nix flake installables (default: false)

   NIX VERSIONS BACKEND

   --channel value      Nixpkgs channel for lazamar backend. Enables lazamar when set. (default: "nixpkgs-unstable")
   --lazamar            Use https://lazamar.co.uk/ntv as backend (default: false)
   --nixhub             Use https://www.nixhub.io/ as backend (default: true)
